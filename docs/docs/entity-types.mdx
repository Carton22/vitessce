To flexibly support many single-cell (e.g., scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq), single-molecule (e.g., MERFISH), and spot-level (e.g., Slide-seq) data modalities,
Vitessce generalizes to __observation-by-feature__ datasets.
The observation-by-feature concept in Vitessce is analogous to the AnnData [obs-by-var](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
SummarizedExperiment [sample-by-feature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3252/figures/2),
and [feature-observation matrix (FOM)](https://github.com/single-cell-data/matrix-api) concepts.

In the Vitessce view config, __entity types__ can be specified for each file definition.
In other words, if a file contains a cell-by-peak count matrix from an scATAC-seq experiment, then the entity type mapping would look like:

```js
entityTypes: {
  obsType: 'cell',
  featureType: 'peak',
  featureValueType: 'count'
}
```

### Default entity type values

The following defaults are used when `entityTypes` is not specified for a file:

<AutogeneratedEntityTypeDefaults />

### Entity types by data type

Not all data types depend on (i.e., store information about) all entity types.
For instance, the `obsFeatureMatrix` data type only depends on `obsType`, `featureType`, and `featureValueType`.

<AutogeneratedEntityTypesPerDataType />

:::caution

Support for entity types was added in version 2.0.0 of the Vitessce JavaScript package.
The documentation here is compatible with view config schema version [`2.0.0`](/docs/view-config-json/#version) and later.
