import { AutogeneratedDefaults } from '../src/pages/_AutogeneratedEntityTypes';

Beyond the cell-by-gene paradigm (typical in the context of scRNA-seq experiments), Vitessce generalizes to observation-by-feature datasets.

This is analogous to [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)'s obs-by-var and [SummarizedExperiment](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3252/figures/2)'s sample-by-feature ideas.

In Vitessce, the default entity types are as follows, but for each file in the JSON view config, an `entityTypes` object can be defined.

### Default entity types

<AutogeneratedDefaults />

### Entity types per data type



Not all data types depend on all entity types.
For instance, the `obs` data type only depends on `obsType`.
