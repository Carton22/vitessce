The deck.gl TileLayer is built around geographic coordinates.
https://github.com/uber/deck.gl/issues/2931

I've copied-and-pasted the code from [`tile-layer`](https://github.com/uber/deck.gl/tree/76291a07239343e9fe1de4e57b08317706facf8c/modules/geo-layers/src/tile-layer)
and will try to make it work with our non-geographic data.

If it does work, I'd like to merge it back into deck.gl. We'll see.
